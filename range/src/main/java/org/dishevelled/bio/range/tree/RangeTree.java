       Additional queries:

       Iterable<Range<C>> closest(Range<C> query);
       Iterable<Set<Range<C>>> closest(Iterable<Range<C>> query);

       bedtools closest options:
         -s Force strandedness. That is, find the closest feature in B overlaps A on the
              same strand. By default, this is disabled.
         -d In addition to the closest feature in B, report its distance to A as an extra
              column. The reported distance for overlapping features will be 0.
         -t How ties for closest feature should be handled. This occurs when two features
              in B have exactly the same overlap with a feature in A. By default, all such
              features in B are reported.

              Here are the other choices controlling how ties are handled:
                all- Report all ties (default).
                first- Report the first tie that occurred in the B file.
                last- Report the last tie that occurred in the B file.
